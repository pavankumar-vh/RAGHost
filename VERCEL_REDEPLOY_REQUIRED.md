# ⚠️ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT CHECK

## The frontend is still not working because:

### Problem: Vercel didn't rebuild with the new environment variables

When you add environment variables to Vercel, **the app doesn't automatically use them**. You MUST redeploy.

## SOLUTION: Force Redeploy on Vercel

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Step 2: Find Your Project
Look for `rag-host` or your frontend project name

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Click **Deployments** tab
2. Find the **latest deployment** (top one)
3. Click the **three dots (...)** button on the right
4. Select **Redeploy**
5. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Wait
- The build takes 2-3 minutes
- Wait until status shows ✅ **Ready**
- DO NOT refresh the site until build is complete

### Step 5: Verify
After deployment completes:
1. Go to https://rag-host.vercel.app
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh)
3. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
4. Look for API calls - they should go to `raghost-pcgw.onrender.com`
5. Try to create a bot

## Quick Verification

### Check if environment variables are set:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Verify you see all 7 VITE_* variables
4. If NOT, add them from `VERCEL_ENV_VARIABLES.txt`
5. If YES, you just need to redeploy

## Current Status:
✅ Backend is RUNNING: https://raghost-pcgw.onrender.com
✅ Backend returns 401 for protected routes (correct behavior)
✅ CORS is configured properly
❌ Frontend not connecting = **Vercel needs redeploy with env vars**

## After Redeploy:
The frontend will:
- Connect to `https://raghost-pcgw.onrender.com` instead of `localhost:5001`
- Firebase will work for authentication
- Create bot, upload docs, chat will all work

## Still not working after redeploy?
Check browser console for errors and share them!
