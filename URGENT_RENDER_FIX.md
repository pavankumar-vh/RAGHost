# üö® URGENT FIX NEEDED ON RENDER

##The embed widgets are showing "Widget Not Available" because Render is still running OLD code.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps:

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (FASTEST - 30 seconds)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service: **raghost-pcgw**
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
4. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Option 2: Add Environment Variable (Forces redeploy)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service: **raghost-pcgw**
3. Go to **"Environment"** tab
4. Add new variable:
   - Key: `ENABLE_LOW_MEMORY`
   - Value: `true`
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Render will auto-redeploy

### Option 3: Push Empty Commit (If auto-deploy is enabled)
```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: Force Render redeploy"
git push origin main
```

## üîç How to Verify It Worked:

After deployment completes, test this URL in your browser:
```
https://raghost-pcgw.onrender.com/api/bots/public/675479cc5dd23d3cf41b9d33
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "id": "675479cc5dd23d3cf41b9d33",
  "name": "Your Bot Name",
  "type": "openai",
  ...
}
```

**If you still see authentication error:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No token provided..."
}
```
Then Render hasn't deployed the latest code yet.

## üìä Check Deployment Status:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Go to **"Events"** tab
4. Look for latest deploy - should show commit: `b59575a`
5. Wait until status shows **"Live"**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What We Fixed:

The issue was that `/api/bots/public/:id` route was being blocked by authentication middleware.

**Fixed by:**
1. Moving public route inside `bots.js` router
2. Placing it BEFORE the `authenticate` middleware
3. This allows public access without tokens

**Commit with fix:** `b59575a` - "Move public bot endpoint to bots router to bypass authentication correctly"

## üÜò If Still Not Working:

Check Render logs for these messages:
- ‚úÖ "Server running on port 10000"
- ‚úÖ "MongoDB connected successfully"
- ‚ùå Any authentication errors when accessing /api/bots/public/

If you see errors, share the Render logs and we'll debug further.

**The code is correct and pushed to GitHub. Render just needs to deploy it!**
